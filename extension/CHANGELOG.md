and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Architecture
- **Extension rewritten in TypeScript** — 8 modular files (`extension.ts`, `server.ts`, `terminal-manager.ts`, `claws-pty.ts`, `capture-store.ts`, `protocol.ts`, `safety.ts`, `ansi-strip.ts`), strict mode, esbuild bundle → `dist/extension.js`.
- **Pseudoterminal replaces `script(1)` wrapping** — wrapped terminals now run under VS Code's native `vscode.Pseudoterminal` with `node-pty` (or `child_process` pipe-mode fallback). Fixes TUI rendering corruption in Claude Code, vim, htop, k9s, and other Ink/ncurses apps.
- **In-memory ring buffer replaces file-tailing** for `readLog` on Pseudoterminal-backed terminals. No more `.claws/terminals/*.log` files for new wrapped terminals; the buffer is configurable via `claws.maxCaptureBytes` (default 1 MB per terminal).

### Added
- **Blocking `claws_worker` lifecycle** — one tool call runs the full worker flow: spawn wrapped terminal → optional Claude Code boot with `boot_marker` detection → send mission → poll capture buffer for `complete_marker` / `error_markers` → harvest last N lines → auto-close → return structured result with `status`, `duration_ms`, `marker_line`, `cleaned_up`, `harvest`. Configurable via `timeout_ms`, `boot_wait_ms`, `poll_interval_ms`, `harvest_lines`, `close_on_complete`. Legacy fire-and-forget behavior via `detach: true`.
- **Project-local install** — `scripts/install.sh` now writes into the current project root as the primary target:
  - `<project>/.mcp.json` — registers Claws MCP server with relative path `./.claws-bin/mcp_server.js`
  - `<project>/.claws-bin/{mcp_server.js,shell-hook.sh}` — self-contained, no dependency on `~/.claws-src`
  - `<project>/.claude/commands/` — all 19 `claws-*` slash commands
  - `<project>/.claude/rules/claws-default-behavior.md`
  - `<project>/.claude/skills/{claws-orchestration-engine,claws-prompt-templates}/`
  - Global `~/.claude/*` install is now opt-in via `CLAWS_GLOBAL_CONFIG=1` and `CLAWS_GLOBAL_MCP=1`.
- **Dynamic CLAUDE.md injection** — fenced with `<!-- CLAWS:BEGIN --> ... <!-- CLAWS:END -->`. Block content is generated at install time (lists actually-installed tools and slash commands). Re-install replaces only the fenced section, preserving every other line of the project's CLAUDE.md.
- **Automatic legacy CLAUDE.md migration** — on upgrade, the installer strips the old `## CLAWS — Terminal Orchestration Active` section (v0.1–v0.3) before inserting the new fenced block. Original project content on either side of the old section is preserved.
- **Extension test suite** — `extension/test/smoke.test.js` (5 checks: bundle load, socket server, protocol, cleanup) and `extension/test/worker.test.js` (6 checks: blocking lifecycle, marker detection, detach mode) — both run via `npm test`.
- **Big end-of-install ASCII banner** with 3-step activation guidance (reload VS Code → restart Claude Code → `/claws-help`) and troubleshooting pointer (`/claws-fix`).

### Changed
- Extension entry point: `main` now points at `./dist/extension.js` (built from TypeScript). Legacy `./src/extension.js` is preserved as a fallback; the installer repoints `main` to it if the TypeScript build fails.
- Install verification expanded from 4 to 10 checks; MCP handshake test uses a portable Node driver (no dependency on GNU `timeout`, works on macOS out of the box).
- `extension/package.json` adds `devDependencies` (`typescript`, `esbuild`, `@types/vscode`, `@types/node`) and `optionalDependencies` (`node-pty`). Pure Node stdlib remains the only runtime requirement.

### Deprecated
- `scripts/terminal-wrapper.sh` — kept for v0.1–v0.3 compatibility but unused by new Pseudoterminal-backed wrapped terminals. Will be removed in v0.5.
- `extension/src/extension.js` (legacy JS) — kept as fallback; will be removed once Pseudoterminal path is marketplace-published.

### Migration notes for v0.3 users running `/claws-update`
- Your project gets a new `.mcp.json`, `.claws-bin/`, and project-local `.claude/` — safe to commit or gitignore per your preference.
- CLAUDE.md's legacy Claws section is automatically stripped and replaced with the new fenced block. Expect to see `CLAUDE.md legacy section migrated; Claws block inserted` during install.
- The old global `~/.claude/settings.json` claws MCP entry remains but becomes inactive when the project-local `.mcp.json` takes precedence. Safe to leave or remove manually.
- `claws_worker` return-text format changed. If you had automation parsing the old output (`worker 'X' spawned with Claude Code...`), it will need updating. The new format leads with `worker 'X' COMPLETED|FAILED|TIMEOUT` followed by structured fields and a `── harvest (last lines) ──` section.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- MCP server rewritten from Python to Node.js — zero dependencies
- Install no longer requires Python, pip, or brew
- Shell hook commands rewritten from Python to Node.js

### Removed
- Python dependency from install path (Python client remains as optional)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **MCP Server** — register once, every Claude Code session gets 8 terminal control tools natively
- **Orchestration Engine skill** — 7 patterns (scout, single worker, parallel fleet, AI session driver, pipeline stages, watchdog, orchestrator with delegation)
- **Lifecycle YAML protocol** — 8-phase terminal lifecycle (plan → spawn → deploy → observe → recover → harvest → cleanup → reflect)
- **Prompt engineering guide** — `/claws-help` with 5 levels from beginner to power user
- **Default behavior rule** — Claude prefers visible Claws terminals over silent Bash
- **CLAUDE.md injection** — installer appends Claws orchestration context to project CLAUDE.md
- **Shell hook** — every terminal shows CLAWS banner with bridge status + 4 shell commands (claws-ls, claws-new, claws-run, claws-log)
- **Auto-launch Claude Code** — `claws_worker` auto-starts `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in worker terminals
- **Click-to-copy install prompt** on landing page
- **npx claws-cli** — Node.js CLI installer with `claude mcp add` support
- **11 slash commands** — /claws-help, /claws-install, /claws-update, /claws-status, /claws-connect, /claws-create, /claws-send, /claws-exec, /claws-read, /claws-worker, /claws-fleet
- **7 prompt templates** — single worker, analysis, multi-commit, pair programming, parallel fleet, graphify-driven, error recovery
- **6 cinematic capability images** — terminal mgmt, pty capture, exec, safety gate, MCP, cross-device
- **GitHub Pages landing page** — full website with carousels, stats, animations, case studies
- **Cross-platform installer** — bash (macOS/Linux) + PowerShell (Windows), auto-detects VS Code/Cursor/Windsurf
- **Live demo test script** — spawns 3 parallel workers to prove orchestration works

### Fixed
- Linux `script(1)` compatibility — auto-detects BSD vs GNU arg order
- Shell injection in `claws-run` — commands passed via temp file, not interpolated
- `nc -U` dependency removed — all shell commands use Python sockets
- Install step numbering consistent [1/8] through [8/8]
- MCP server tilde path warning in docs
- Installer never exits — `set +e`, all checks are warnings not blockers
- `pip` install uses `python -m pip` with `--break-system-packages` for macOS compatibility

### Changed
- `/claws-update` is now a full rebuild (re-runs entire installer), not just git pull

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Initial release
- Unix socket server with newline-delimited JSON protocol
- Terminal management: list, create, show, send, close
- Wrapped terminals via `script(1)` for full pty capture
- `readLog` command with ANSI stripping
- `exec` command with file-based output capture
- `poll` command for shell-integration event streaming
- Safety gate: foreground process detection + warnings for non-shell TUIs
- Bracketed paste mode for multi-line sends
- "Claws Wrapped Terminal" dropdown profile
- Python client library (`claws-client`)
- Example scripts: basic orchestrator, parallel workers
